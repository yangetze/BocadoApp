## 2025-01-16 - Prevent Prisma IDOR with Nested Operations
**Vulnerability:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) with nested relations.
**Learning:** Using `userId` inside `where` or nested operations in Prisma's `update` and `delete` can fail to properly authorize if the table lacks a compound unique constraint or if it's updating nested relations inside a transaction.
**Prevention:** Always explicitly fetch the parent record via `findUnique` and perform an in-memory verification (`if (record.userId !== req.user.id)`) before attempting an update or delete, especially when using `$transaction`. Return a 404 Not Found (not 403) to prevent information leakage.
