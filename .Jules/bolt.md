## 2024-04-09 - Ingredient Model Refactoring
 **Learning:** When calculating costs based on dynamic quantities rather than fixed per-unit costs, we must carefully migrate calculations across the full stack (backend logic, frontend components, and test scenarios) to respect the new structure, especially ensuring new fields like `globalPriceQuantity` do not cause division-by-zero errors.
 **Action:** Make sure to set a default fallback (e.g. `|| 1`) when dividing by quantity denominators introduced during refactors to prevent mathematical exceptions.
